Design two objects, HtmlElement and HtmlSelectElement. 
HtmlElement has "click" instance method and "focus" prototype method. 

const e = new HtmlElement();
e.click() and e.focus();

Then, create "HtmlSelectElement" with items (optional), addItem, removeItem members. 
HtmlSelectElement needs to inherit "click" and "focus" methods.
